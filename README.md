# user-platform-behavior-analysis
This project explores user interaction data from a digital platform. The dataset includes log records and user profile data.

## Stack used
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Datasets
- `logs.csv`: user activity logs 
- `user_data.csv`: user profiles 

## Techniques applied
- Data cleaning and merging
- Filtering and aggregation
- Visual exploration with seaborn (bar plots, histograms, count plots)
- Feature engineering (`success_true`, platform filtering)

## Visualizations include:
- Distribution of successful operations per user
- Platform usage among premium users
- Age distribution across users by platform
- Age breakdown of users performing successful operations via computer

## Goal:
Practice working with joined datasets, grouping and aggregation, and visualizing data distributions using seaborn.
